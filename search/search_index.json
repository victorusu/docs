For end users, we want to provide a uniform user experience with respect to available scientific software, regardless of which system they use. Our software stack should work on laptops, personal workstations, HPC clusters and in the cloud, which means we will need to support different CPUs, networks, GPUs, and so on. We hope to make this work for any Linux distribution and maybe even macOS and Windows via WSL , and a wide variety of CPU architectures (Intel, AMD, ARM, POWER, RISC-V). Of course we want to focus on the performance of the software, but also on automating the workflow for maintaining the software stack, thoroughly testing the installations, and collaborating efficiently. Inspiration \u00b6 The EESSI concept is heavily inspired by Compute Canada software stack, which is a shared software stack used on all 5 major national systems in Canada and a bunch of smaller ones. The design of the Compute Canada software stack is discussed in detail in the PEARC'19 paper \"Providing a Unified Software Environment for Canada\u2019s National Advanced Computing Centers\" . It has also been presented at the 5th EasyBuild User Meetings ( slides , recorded talk ), and is well documented . Layered structure \u00b6 The EESSI project consists of 3 layers. The bottom layer is the filesystem layer , which is responsible for distributing the software stack across clients. The middle layer is a compatibility layer , which ensures that the software stack is compatible with multiple different client operating systems. The top layer is the software layer , which contains the actual scientific software applications and their dependencies. The host OS still provides a couple of things, like drivers for network and GPU, support for shared filesystems like GPFS and Lustre, a resource manager like Slurm, and so on. Opportunities \u00b6 We hope to collaborate with interested parties across the HPC community, including HPC centres, vendors, consultancy companies and scientific software developers. Through our software stack, HPC users can seamlessly hop between sites, since the same software is available everywhere. We can leverage each others work with respect to providing tested and properly optimized scientific software installations more efficiently, and provide a platform for easy benchmarking of new systems. By working together with the developers of scientific software we can provide vetted installations for the broad HPC community. Challenges \u00b6 There are many challenges in an ambitious project like this, including (but probably not limited to): Finding time and manpower to get the software stack set up properly; Leveraging system sources like network interconnect (MPI & co), accelerators (GPUs), ...; Supporting CPU architectures other than x86_64, including ARM, POWER, RISC-V, ... Dealing with licensed software, like Intel tools, MATLAB, ANSYS, ...; Integration with resource managers (Slurm) and vendor provided software (Cray PE); Convincing HPC site admins to adopt EESSI; Current status \u00b6 (June 2020) We are actively working on a pilot setup that has a limited scope, and are organizing monthly meetings to discuss progress and next steps forward.

Do not use it for production work, and be careful when testing it on production systems! Reporting problems \u00b6 If you notice any problems, please report them via https://github.com/EESSI/software-layer/issues. Accessing the EESSI pilot repository through Singularity \u00b6 The easiest way to access the EESSI pilot repository is by using Singularity. If Singularity is installed already, no admin privileges are required. No other software is needed either on the host. A container image is available in Docker Hub (see https://hub.docker.com/r/eessi/client-pilot ). It only contains a minimal operating system + the necessary packages to access the EESSI pilot repository through CernVM-FS. The container image can be used directly by Singularity (no prior download required), as follows: First, create some local directories in /tmp/$USER which will be bind mounted in the container: mkdir -p /tmp/ $USER / { var-lib-cvmfs,var-run-cvmfs,home } These provides space for the CernVM-FS cache, and an empty home directory to use in the container. Set the $SINGULARITY_BIND and $SINGULARITY_HOME environment variables to configure Singularity: export SINGULARITY_BIND = \"/tmp/ $USER /var-run-cvmfs:/var/run/cvmfs,/tmp/ $USER /var-lib-cvmfs:/var/lib/cvmfs\" export SINGULARITY_HOME = \"/tmp/ $USER /home:/home/ $USER \" Start the container using singularity shell , using --fusemount to mount the EESSI config and pilot repositories (using the cvmfs2 command that is included in the container image): export EESSI_CONFIG = \"container:cvmfs2 cvmfs-config.eessi-hpc.org /cvmfs/cvmfs-config.eessi-hpc.org\" export EESSI_PILOT = \"container:cvmfs2 pilot.eessi-hpc.org /cvmfs/pilot.eessi-hpc.org\" singularity shell --fusemount \" $EESSI_CONFIG \" --fusemount \" $EESSI_PILOT \" docker://eessi/client-pilot:centos7- $( uname -m ) This should give you a shell in the container, where the EESSI config and pilot repositories are mounted: $ singularity shell --fusemount \"$EESSI_CONFIG\" --fusemount \"$EESSI_PILOT\" docker://eessi/client-pilot:centos7-$(uname -m) INFO: Using cached SIF image CernVM-FS: pre-mounted on file descriptor 3 CernVM-FS: pre-mounted on file descriptor 3 CernVM-FS: loading Fuse module... done CernVM-FS: loading Fuse module... done Singularity> It is possible that you see some scary looking warnings, but those can be ignored for now. To verify that things are working, check the contents of the /cvmfs/pilot.eessi-hpc.org/2020.12 directory: Singularity> ls /cvmfs/pilot.eessi-hpc.org/2020.12 compat init software Setting up the EESSI environment \u00b6 Once you have the EESSI pilot repository mounted, you can set up the environment by sourcing the provided init script: source /cvmfs/pilot.eessi-hpc.org/2020.12/init/bash If all goes well, you should see output like this: Singularity> source /cvmfs/pilot.eessi-hpc.org/2020.12/init/bash Found EESSI pilot repo @ /cvmfs/pilot.eessi-hpc.org/2020.12!

As a result, 'module' commands may be somewhat slow. ( see also https://github.com/EESSI/software-layer/issues/10 ) Environment set up to use EESSI pilot software stack, have fun! [ EESSI pilot 2020 .12 ] $ Now you're all set up! Go ahead and explore the software stack using \" module avail \", and go wild with testing the available software installations! Testing the EESSI pilot software stack \u00b6 Please test the EESSI pilot software stack as you see fit: running simple commands, performing small calculations or running small benchmarks, etc. Test scripts that have been verified to work correctly using the pilot software stack are available at https://github.com/EESSI/software-layer/tree/master/tests .

To install the software we include in our stack, we use EasyBuild , a framework for installing scientific software on HPC systems. These installations are optimized for a particular system architecture (specific CPU and GPU generation). To access these software installation we provide environment module files and use Lmod , a modern environment modules tool which has been widely adopted in the HPC community in recent years. We leverage the archspec Python library to automatically select the best suited part of the software stack for a particular host, based on its system architecture. The software layer is maintained through our https://github.com/EESSI/software-layer GitHub repository.","title":"Software layer"}]}
